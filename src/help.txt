Lambda is a collection of interpreters of lambda calculi. We currently support
the following variants:
- Untyped lambda calculus (λ)
- Simply-typed lambda calculus (λ→)

We plan to support the following variants in the future:
- System F (λ2)

Use ?about to get information about the variant of lambda calculus you're using.
Use ?exit or ?quit or ?q to exit.
Use ?switch [variant] to change the interpreter or list the available variants.
Use ?defs [set] to load a definition set or list the available definition sets.
Use ?run <filename> to load a definition set from a file.
