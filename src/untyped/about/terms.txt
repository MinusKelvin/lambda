There are 3 kinds of lambda terms:
* Variables, written '𝑥', where 𝑥 is a variable name.

* Abstraction, written 'λ𝑥. 𝑒' where 𝑥 is a variable name and 𝑒 is a lambda
  term. The abstraction binds 𝑥 in 𝑒. Abstraction reaches as far right as
  possible; 'λx. x y' is the same as 'λx. (x y)', not '(λx. x) y'.

* Application, written '𝑢 𝑣' where 𝑢 and 𝑣 are both lambda terms. Application
  is left associative; 'a b c' is the same as '(a b) c', not 'a (b c)'.

Variables are considered either free or bound. Given a lambda term 𝑒, a
variable 𝑥 is free in 𝑒 if it is not bound, and 𝑥 is bound in 𝑒 if all
occurrences of 𝑥 appear within abstractions that bind 𝑥.

For example, the variable x is bound in the lambda term 'λx. x' as x only
appears within the abstraction 'λx. x' which binds it. The variable x is also
bound in 'λy. y' by vacuous truth. Conversely, the variable x is free in both
'x' and 'λy. x' since x has occurrences outside of any abstractions that bind x.

Lastly, a lambda term 𝑒 is considered closed if no variables are free in 𝑒.
This interpreter requires that its input lambda terms are closed and will
produce an error if you give it input that is not closed.
