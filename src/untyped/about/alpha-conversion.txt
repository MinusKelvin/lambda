The rule for α-conversion is:
  (λx. m) -> (λy. m[x := y])
where `y` does not appear in `m`

An example of α-conversion:
             < λx. λy. y x
intermediate | λz. (λy. y x)[x := z]
intermediate | λz. λy. (y x)[x := z]
intermediate | λz. λy. y[x := z] x[x := z]
α-conversion | λz. λy. y z

An example of a case where α-conversion is required to avoid a name collision:
             < (λx. λy. x) y
α-conversion | (λx. λz. x) y
β-reduction  | λz. y
Without the alpha conversion, this would β-reduce to `λy. y`, which is incorrect
and not α-equivalent to `λz. y`.
